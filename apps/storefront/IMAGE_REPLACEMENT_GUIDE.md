## How to Replace Images

   - `chef_book_experience.jpg`
3. Navigate to: `apps/storefront/public/assets/images/`
4. Replace the existing files with your new images

### Method 2: Custom File Names

If you prefer different file names:

## Image Optimization Tips

### Before Uploading

1. **Resize Images**: Use correct dimensions (don't rely on CSS to resize)
2. **Compress**: Use tools like:
   - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - Easy drag-and-drop
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - Advanced controls
   - ImageOptim (Mac)
   - GIMP (Free, cross-platform)

3. **Quality Settings**:
   - JPG Quality: 80-85% is usually perfect
   - Aim for <500KB for hero images
   - Aim for <400KB for section images

4. **File Format Guidelines**:
   - **JPG**: Best for photos (recommended)
   - **PNG**: Use only if transparency needed (rare for these images)
   - **WebP**: Modern format, but ensure fallback for older browsers

### Test Your Images

After uploading, verify:
- [ ] Images load quickly (< 1 second on 3G)
- [ ] Images look sharp on retina displays
- [ ] Images are properly cropped/centered
- [ ] Text overlay is readable (for hero image)
- [ ] Images work on mobile devices
- [ ] No stretched or distorted images
