## Summary

We implemented **experience types** and full support for them in a sibling project (**sdoa**). We need to do the same for this template repo. The authoritative reference for scope and file-level patterns is the sibling technical doc: `/Users/pablo/Personal/development/sdoa/sdoa/docs/experience-types.md` — it covers the Medusa `experience-type` module (model, migrations, service helpers), admin and store HTTP APIs, chef-event linkage (`experience_type_id`, `eventType`, pickup/product-based fields), `createChefEvent` / `acceptChefEvent` workflows, extended Admin SDK + React Query hooks + admin routes, storefront loaders and server helpers (`experience-types.server.ts`, chef-events POST payload), request-form integration, and seeding.

In **this** codebase, experience types appear partly as **static UI data** (for example `ExperienceTypes.tsx`, `EventTypeSelector.tsx`) and scripts reference `experience_type_id`, but the **end-to-end catalog module, APIs, and dynamic request flow** described in that document are not yet assumed to exist here. This task tracks closing that gap so the template matches the proven sibling architecture, adapted to this monorepo's layout and any intentional differences discovered during research.

## Agent Update Instructions

- Always update "Last Updated" to today's date (ISO: YYYY-MM-DD) when editing this file. **Get the current date by explicitly running `date +%Y-%m-%d` first, then use the output for the "Last Updated" field.**
- Progress Log: Append a new entry at the end in the form `- [YYYY-MM-DD] Event: concise update, links to files`. Do not rewrite or delete prior entries. **Use the date retrieved from `date +%Y-%m-%d` for the date portion.**
- Implementation Checklist: Mark items as `[x]` when complete, `[~]` for partial with a short note. Add new items if discovered; avoid removing items—strike through only when obsolete.
- Key Decisions: Record important decisions as `- [YYYY-MM-DD] Decision: rationale, links`. **Use the date retrieved from `date +%Y-%m-%d` for the date portion.**
- References: Keep links current to latest spec, research, and tasks. Add additional references as they are created.
- Scope: Edits here should reflect coordination/progress only; do not include application code changes. Preserve history.

## Key Decisions

- [2026-04-11] Decision: Track experience-types parity as a dedicated task hub; implementation waits on `devagent research` / `devagent create-plan` (no application changes during scaffolding).
- [2026-04-11] Decision (clarify-task): **v1** — `eventType` stays **three** values (`cooking_class`, `plated_dinner`, `buffet_style`); **`pickup` omitted until phase 2** (Q5 B). Catalog->workflow mapping: **plan decides** explicit field vs slug convention (Q4 C). Homepage + request: **single API source** (Q3 A). Link: `clarification/2026-04-11_initial-clarification.md`.
- [2026-04-11] Decision (create-plan): **Q4 -> explicit `workflow_event_type`** on `experience_type` (enum = three chef-event buckets). v1 **rejects** `product_based` / `is_product_based` in admin APIs. Server **authoritative** `eventType` when `experience_type_id` present on store POST. Five tasks + phase 2 backlog in plan doc. Link: `plan/2026-04-11_experience-types-v1-implementation-plan.md`.
- [2026-04-13] Decision (v1.1): Removed `workflow_event_type` enum entirely; `chef_event.eventType` is now free text storing the experience name. No fixed enum, fully dynamic experience types.
- [2026-04-13] Decision (v1.2): Pricing is now **menu x experience type** based. New `menu_experience_price` join table in the menu module. Chef sets per-person pricing for each experience type on each menu. Deprecates `PRICING_STRUCTURE` / `FALLBACK_PRICING` and `experience_type.price_per_unit`. Tasks 7-10 added to plan.

## Progress Log

- [2026-04-11] Event: Created task hub and `AGENTS.md` from template; ready for research and planning against sibling `experience-types.md`.
- [2026-04-11] Event: Completed `devagent research` — artifact `research/2026-04-11_experience-types-parity-research.md` (gaps vs SDOA, `cooking_class` vs `pickup` enum decision, seed naming collision on `experience_type_id`).
- [2026-04-11] Event: Started `devagent clarify-task` — `clarification/2026-04-11_initial-clarification.md` (batch 1: enum, pickup v1, marketing vs catalog); awaiting stakeholder answers.
- [2026-04-11] Event: Clarify-task batch 1 answered — Q1 **C** (four `eventType` values incl. `pickup`), Q2 **A** (no pickup/product flow in v1), Q3 **A** (homepage + request from API). Batch 2 (workflow mapping + pickup in schema vs UX) pending.
- [2026-04-11] Event: Clarify-task **complete** — Q4 **C** (plan picks catalog->`eventType` mapping); Q5 **B** (no `pickup` in schema until phase 2; **v1 = three `eventType` values**). Packet status **Complete**; ready for `devagent create-plan`.
- [2026-04-11] Event: **`devagent create-plan`** — `plan/2026-04-11_experience-types-v1-implementation-plan.md` (Tasks 1-5: module, APIs, chef-event+POST, admin UI, storefront+seed+naming). Next: `devagent implement-plan` or explicit implementation.
- [2026-04-13] Event: **v1.1 implemented** — Tasks 1-6 complete. `workflow_event_type` removed; `chef_event.eventType` is free text; email label resolution from catalog; all subscribers updated.
- [2026-04-13] Event: **v1.2 plan update** — Added Tasks 7-10 for menu x experience type pricing. New `menu_experience_price` join table, admin Pricing tab, store API pricing exposure, storefront pricing integration, workflow/subscriber pricing updates.

## Implementation Checklist

### Research & Planning
- [x] Read `/Users/pablo/Personal/development/sdoa/sdoa/docs/experience-types.md` and map each area (module, migrations, APIs, workflows, admin UI, storefront, seed) to this repo's paths. — See research packet mapping and SDOA file index.
- [x] Inventory this repo: `chef-event` model and store/admin routes, request route and event-request components, seed/init scripts, and any existing `experience_type` usage — note gaps vs the reference doc. — See research packet findings.
- [x] Decide scope for v1 (full parity including pickup/product-based vs phased) and document deltas in a research or plan artifact. — `clarification/2026-04-11_initial-clarification.md` (v1 three enums, no pickup in schema; phase 2 pickup).

### Tasks 1-6: Dynamic Experience Types (v1.0/v1.1)
- [x] Task 1: Implement Medusa `experience-type` module, migrations, and registration in Medusa config.
- [x] Task 2: Add admin and store experience-types routes.
- [x] Task 3: Convert `chef_event.eventType` to text; add `experience_type_id` FK; update workflows and store POST.
- [x] Task 4: Port Admin SDK resource, hooks, and admin UI routes for experience type CRUD; sidebar placement.
- [x] Task 5: Replace static storefront data with server-backed fetch; wire request form; seed script.
- [x] Task 6: Email label resolution from catalog; subscriber updates.

### Tasks 7-10: Menu x Experience Type Pricing (v1.2)
- [ ] Task 7: `menu_experience_price` model + migration in menu module; admin API + Pricing tab on menu edit form.
- [ ] Task 8: Store API — expose menu pricing for storefront consumption.
- [ ] Task 9: Storefront request flow — use menu x experience pricing for estimation and submission.
- [ ] Task 10: Workflow + subscriber + accept pricing updates — use stored `totalPrice`; deprecate hardcoded pricing maps.

### Cross-cutting
- [ ] Add tests appropriate to touched surfaces (API, workflow, storefront) per project testing conventions.
- [ ] Run `medusa db:migrate` and verify E2E request flow with menu x experience pricing.

## Open Questions

- **Resolved (v1.0):** Plan chose **explicit `workflow_event_type`** on catalog model.
- **Resolved (v1.1):** `workflow_event_type` removed entirely; `chef_event.eventType` is free text.
- **Resolved (v1.2):** Pricing is menu x experience type based via `menu_experience_price` join table. `PRICING_STRUCTURE` / `FALLBACK_PRICING` and `experience_type.price_per_unit` deprecated.
- **Phase 2:** When to schedule `pickup` + SDOA-style product-based flow (not blocking v1 implementation).

## Next Steps

- **Implement Tasks 7-10** — Menu x experience type pricing (v1.2).
- Run `medusa db:migrate` after Task 7 migration is created.
- Verify E2E: admin sets menu pricing -> storefront shows correct estimates -> request submission stores correct `totalPrice` -> acceptance/emails reflect correct pricing.
