# Order Commission Widget — Stripe Processing Fees Line

## Summary

Extend the **Medusa admin order payout summary** implemented in `apps/medusa/src/admin/widgets/order-commission-widget.tsx`. The widget already shows **platform commission** and **chef take-home**. The goal is to add a **line item for Stripe processing fees** so the breakdown reconciles (gross → fees → platform commission → chef net, or an equivalent equation that is explicit and correct).

**Business context:** Payments use **Stripe Connect** (connected account). Processing fees are incurred on the **platform** side, but the product intent is to **pass those fees through to the connected account (chef)**—so the admin UI should reflect that fee as something that reduces what the chef ultimately receives (or otherwise makes the numbers add up in a way operators can trust).

## Key Decisions

- [2026-03-28] Clarification (see `clarification/2026-03-28_initial-clarification.md`): v1 shows **estimated** Stripe processing fees only (provider formula); **hide** the row when pass-through is off; label **Stripe processing fees**; platform commission row = **net of** that estimate when pass-through on; persist fee/flag on `payment.data` for admin.

## Progress Log

- [2026-03-28] Event: Task hub scaffolded via `devagent new-task`; ready for clarification, research, and planning.
- [2026-03-28] Event: Research packet — `research/2026-03-28_stripe-processing-fee-line-order-widget.md` (provider gross-up, persistence gaps, Balance Transaction vs estimate, per-line inconsistency).
- [2026-03-28] Event: Clarification session started — `clarification/2026-03-28_initial-clarification.md` (Round 1: fee source, pass-through-off UX, copy).
- [2026-03-28] Event: Clarification complete — Round 1 answers **1A, 2A, 3A**; packet status Complete; ready for `create-plan`.
- [2026-03-28] Event: Plan created — `plan/2026-03-28_order-commission-widget-stripe-fees.md` (4 implementation tasks: util/types, provider persistence + per-line gross-up, medusa-config/env, admin widget).
- [2026-03-28] Event: **Implemented** — `estimate-stripe-processing-fee.ts`, provider `payoutAdminFieldsForAmount` + per-line gross-up, `medusa-config` / `.env.template`, `order-commission-widget.tsx`; removed provider `console.log`; `yarn workspace medusa build` passed.
- [2026-03-28] Event: Follow-up UX — payout rows show amounts only (no commission “math” sublabels); removed `platform-commission-sublabel` plumbing and Stripe “Estimated” sublabel.
- [2026-03-28] Event: Task moved to completed. Updated all status references and file paths from `active/` to `completed/` throughout task directory.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Fee source for v1: **estimated** fee on `payment.data` (`stripe_processing_fee_estimate`, `pass_stripe_fee_to_chef`); no browser Stripe calls.
- [x] Breakdown math: charged → optional Stripe fees (est.) → platform commission (net) → chef take-home = gross − `application_fee_amount`.
- [x] Provider persists fields on initiate/authorize/capture/retrieve/update (Connect).
- [x] Admin widget conditional row + net platform commission.
- [~] Manual admin spot-check with `PASS_STRIPE_FEE_TO_CHEF=true` / `false` — optional in ops; implementation verified via build.

## Open Questions

- ~~Fee timing / actual vs estimate~~ — **Resolved:** v1 = **estimate** at capture; no async “pending” for actual fees.
- ~~Copy~~ — **Resolved:** neutral **Stripe processing fees**; no “passed through” in the label.
- Do any orders use non–Stripe Connect providers where this line should be hidden? — **Unchanged:** widget already scoped to stripe-connect payment rows only.
