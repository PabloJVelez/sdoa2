## Clarified Requirements

### Scope & End Goal

**What needs to be done?**
- Implement Google Calendar integration for one chef/admin account only.

**What's the end goal architecture or state?**
- Medusa admin-side integration with connect flow, sync pipeline, and verification paths.
- MVP sync direction is linked-event bidirectional: app-linked events can sync from app to Google and from Google back to app.

**In-scope (must-have):**
- Single connected Google account support.
- Chef event synchronization with linked-event bidirectional behavior.
- Explicit timezone support in schema before sync launch.

**Out-of-scope (won't-have):**
- Multi-admin or multi-chef account routing in MVP.
- Full Google-native event import that is not linked from app records.

**Nice-to-have (could be deferred):**
- Full bidirectional sync behavior if not required for initial release.

### Technical Constraints & Requirements
- Must follow existing Medusa + TypeScript patterns and current admin integration style.
- Must preserve existing app behavior when no Google account is connected.
- OAuth scope choice for MVP is `calendar.events`.
- Google sync should be silent (no attendee notification side-effects) in MVP.

### Dependencies & Blockers
- OAuth consent configuration and production scope approval.
- [Resolved] Conflict resolution behavior: last-write-wins by timestamp.
- Research baseline adoption is deferred to planning discussion (`create-plan`).

### Implementation Approach
- Mirror existing Stripe Connect widget and admin route patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria & Verification
- Linked-event bidirectional sync supports app and Google updates for all mapped editable fields.
- App lifecycle triggers for Google updates include create, update, cancel, and completion status updates.
- Sync writes are silent (`sendUpdates=none`) in MVP.
- Conflict resolution follows last-write-wins by timestamp.
- App cancellation maps to Google event `status=cancelled` (history preserved).
- MVP done threshold is manual QA checklist only.

3. Should timezone be treated as required schema work in MVP? → **A. Yes, required** (PabloJVelez)
4. Which Google-side edits should write back into app events? → **D. Any editable mapped field** (PabloJVelez)
5. Which app lifecycle events trigger Google updates in MVP? → **C. Create + update + cancel + completion status updates** (PabloJVelez)
6. How should outbound Google notifications be handled? → **A. Silent sync only** (PabloJVelez)
7. Conflict policy for overlapping app/Google edits? → **D. Last-write-wins** (PabloJVelez)
8. On app cancellation, how should Google be handled? → **A. Set `status=cancelled`** (PabloJVelez)
9. MVP done threshold? → **A. Manual QA checklist only** (PabloJVelez)
10. Treat existing research packet as accepted baseline for planning? → **D. Defer to planning** (PabloJVelez)
11. Clarification scope mode? → **A. Full task clarification** (PabloJVelez)

**Unresolved Items:**
- [⏭️ deferred] Decide in `create-plan` how strongly to bind to research packet recommendations vs clarification decisions.

## Next Steps

### Spec Readiness Assessment
**Status:** ⬜ Ready for Spec | ⬜ Research Needed | ✅ More Clarification Needed

**Rationale:**
- More clarification needed before plan creation.

### Recommended Actions
- Run `devagent create-plan` using this clarification packet as primary requirements source.
- In planning, explicitly resolve the deferred baseline question for research packet usage.
