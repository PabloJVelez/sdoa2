# Clarified Requirement Packet — Event Menu Template Derivation

- Requestor: PabloJVelez (Repository Owner) [INFERRED]
- Decision Maker: PabloJVelez (Repository Owner) [INFERRED]
- Date: 2026-04-26
- Mode: Task Clarification
- Status: Complete
- Related Task Hub: `.devagent/workspace/tasks/completed/2026-04-26_event-menu-template-derivation/`
- Notes: Initialized from inferred context because `/clarify-task` was invoked without explicit input context.

## Task Overview

### Context
- **Task name/slug:** `2026-04-26_event-menu-template-derivation`
- **Business context:** Event-linked menu editing currently risks modifying template menus; requirement is event-specific customization while preserving template integrity.
- **Stakeholders:** PabloJVelez (Requestor + Decision Maker) [INFERRED]
- **Prior work:**
  - `.devagent/workspace/tasks/completed/2026-04-26_event-menu-template-derivation/AGENTS.md`
  - `.devagent/workspace/tasks/completed/2026-04-26_event-menu-template-derivation/research/2026-04-26_event-menu-template-derivation-research.md`

### Inferred Task Concept
Enable chef events to branch from template menus into event-specific draft menus so chefs can customize per event without changing template menus.

### Assumptions
- [INFERRED] One-chef/single-admin context applies.
- [INFERRED] Clarification scope is full task validation for downstream `devagent create-plan`.
- [INFERRED] Existing menu status lifecycle (`draft`/`active`/`inactive`) remains in effect unless clarified otherwise.

### Clarification Sessions
- Session 1: 2026-04-26 — Participants: PabloJVelez (Requestor/Decision Maker), Codex (facilitator). Topics: scope boundaries, data ownership, acceptance verification.

## Clarified Requirements

### Scope & End Goal

**What needs to be done?**
- Implement event-menu customization so editing from a chef event never mutates the source template menu.

**What's the end goal architecture or state?**
- Chef event customization uses a derived menu draft as the editable target; template menu remains source-only for event context.

**In-scope (must-have):**
- Prevent template menu mutation when editing from chef-event context.
- Support event-specific menu derivation/editing workflow.

**Out-of-scope (won't-have):**
- Multi-chef / multi-admin calendar/menu ownership.

**Nice-to-have (could be deferred):**
- Audit lineage fields on menu records.

---

### Technical Constraints & Requirements

**Platform/technical constraints:**
- Medusa v2 backend + admin routes/workflows.
- Existing menu lifecycle model in place.

**Architecture requirements:**
- Preserve source template reference and event-specific editable reference separation.

**Quality bars:**
- No regression to storefront menu visibility behavior.

---

### Dependencies & Blockers

**Technical dependencies:**
- Existing `duplicate-menu` service/workflow and chef-event admin routes.

**Blockers or risks:**
- Ensure implementation enforces template reference lock after derivation.
- Ensure repeated customize action resolves to existing derived menu (no accidental extra forks).

---

### Implementation Approach

**Implementation strategy:**
- Reuse duplication primitives and implement create-or-get event-derived menu workflow.
- Decision-maker model confirmed: requestor is final authority for requirement tradeoffs.

---

### Acceptance Criteria & Verification

**How will we verify this works?**
- Derived menu pricing should start as exact copy from template at creation time (then editable unless later constrained).
- Derived menu starts in `draft` status and remains non-storefront-visible unless explicitly activated elsewhere.
- Once derived menu exists, template reference remains locked for that chef event.

**What does "done" look like?**
- [ ] Clarified and agreed by decision maker
- [ ] Plan-ready requirement packet

## Clarification Session Log

### Session 1: 2026-04-26
**Participants:** PabloJVelez (Requestor/Decision Maker), Codex

**Question Tracker**
1. Who is final decision maker for requirement tradeoffs? — ✅ answered (A: requestor/owner is final decision maker)
2. Should `templateProductId` become locked after deriving event menu? — ✅ answered (A: lock template reference after derivation)
3. Should event-derived menu pricing matrix start as exact copy or support immediate divergence? — ✅ answered (A: exact copy at derivation)
4. Should derived menu status behavior stay as default draft/non-storefront-visible? — ✅ answered (A: keep default behavior)
5. Is clarification complete and ready for create-plan handoff? — ✅ answered (A: yes)

**Questions Asked:**
- Q1 answered: Final decision maker = requestor (Pablo).
- Q2 answered: lock template reference once derived menu exists.
- Q3 answered: pricing rows should be copied exactly at derivation time.
- Q4 answered: keep existing default status behavior (`draft` start, not storefront-visible by default).
- Q5 answered: finalize clarification and hand off to create-plan.

**Unresolved Items:**
- None.

## Next Steps

### Spec Readiness Assessment
**Status:** ☑ Ready for Spec | ⬜ Research Needed | ⬜ More Clarification Needed

**Rationale:**
All critical clarification questions were answered by the decision maker. Requirements are sufficiently constrained for `devagent create-plan`.

### Recommended Actions
- [x] Hand validated requirement packet to planning workflow (`devagent create-plan`)
- [x] Include research packet and task tracker as supporting context
- [ ] Start implementation only after plan artifact is generated and reviewed
