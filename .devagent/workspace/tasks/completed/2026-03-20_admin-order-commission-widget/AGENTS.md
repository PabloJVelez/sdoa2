# Admin Order Commission Visibility Progress Tracker

- Owner: PabloJVelez
- Last Updated: 2026-03-20
- Status: Complete
- Task Hub: `.devagent/workspace/tasks/completed/2026-03-20_admin-order-commission-widget/`

## Summary

Add visibility on the **Medusa admin orders** experience so chefs can see **commission collected per order** (how much the platform took). The expectation is that this amount is already available or can be sourced from the **Stripe PaymentIntent** (for example via `application_fee_amount` or related metadata when using Stripe Connect / destination charges). The deliverable is an **admin UI widget** (or equivalent order detail surface) that surfaces that commission figure clearly for each order, aligned with how payments are captured in this template.

## Key Decisions

- [2026-03-20] Decision: Track this work as a dedicated task hub; implementation deferred until research and planning confirm where PaymentIntent data is stored or retrievable for a Medusa order in this codebase.

## Progress Log

- [2026-03-20] Event: Created task hub and initial AGENTS.md for admin order commission visibility; ready for research and planning workflows.
- [2026-03-20] Event: Completed research packet — Stripe Connect fee on PI, provider `data` merge risk, Medusa admin widget zones (`order.details.*`), API `payment_sessions[].data`; see `research/2026-03-20_admin-order-commission-visibility.md`.
- [2026-03-20] Event: Clarification session started — `clarification/2026-03-20_initial-clarification.md` (Q1–Q3 pending stakeholder answers).
- [2026-03-20] Event: Clarification complete — order detail only; provider must persist `application_fee_amount` in v1 (no on-demand Stripe fallback); UI label “Platform commission”. See `clarification/2026-03-20_initial-clarification.md`.
- [2026-03-20] Event: Plan created — 3 tasks: enrich provider lifecycle `data`, create order commission admin widget, verify `AdminOrder` prop depth. See `plan/2026-03-20_admin-order-commission-widget.md`.
- [2026-03-20] Event: Implemented plan — `authorizePayment` / `capturePayment` / `retrievePayment` now persist `application_fee_amount` + `connected_account_id`; admin widget `order-commission-widget.tsx` (`order.details.side.after`) refetches order with expanded payment `data`; `formatFromSmallestUnit` in `get-smallest-unit.ts`. `yarn medusa build` passed.
- [2026-03-20] Event: Follow-up UX — widget reads `payment_collections.payments` + provider id `pp_stripe-connect_stripe-connect`; zone `order.details.side.before`; payout line items (charged, platform commission, chef take-home); title **Payout summary**; no Stripe account id in UI.
- [2026-03-20] Event: Task moved to completed. Updated all status references and file paths from active/ to completed/ throughout task directory.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Confirm how orders link to payment sessions / captures and where Stripe PaymentIntent IDs or fee fields are persisted (Medusa payment collection, custom module, or provider metadata).
- [x] Verify what commission data exists on the PaymentIntent today (`application_fee_amount`, metadata, etc.) and whether anything must be added at capture time for reliable admin display.
- [x] Identify the correct Medusa Admin extension point (order detail widget, custom section, or API + UI) consistent with this repo’s admin setup.
- [x] Design the widget copy and formatting (currency, cents vs major units, empty/partial states when fee is unavailable).
- [x] Implement the admin widget and any loader/API needed to read commission per order.
- [~] Add tests or manual verification steps for orders with and without Connect fees — manual verification done in admin; automated tests not added (acceptable for v1).

## Open Questions

- Is commission always represented by Stripe’s application fee on the PaymentIntent, or are there multiple fee models (tickets vs bento, etc.) that need separate display lines?
- Should historical orders without stored fee data show “—” or trigger a backfill/read from Stripe on demand (with rate limits and permissions)?

## Next Steps

Task archived in `completed/`. Further product decisions can open a new task hub if needed.
